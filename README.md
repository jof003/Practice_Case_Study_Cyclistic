# Case_Study_Practice_Cyclistic
This a case study from the Google Data Analytics Certificate. This folder include the case study (PDF file) and the analysis performed in R (the 'Cyclistic_Analysis...' R, R markdown, and an html files. The results are presented as visualizations in Tableau ('Cyclistic_Results_Dashboard.twb' and 'Cyclistic_Results_Visualizations.twb'; a screenshot of the dashboard is also included) and a PowerPoint presentation was developed to present the outcomes of the analysis ('Cyclistic_Results_PowerPoint.pptx'). The output files to use in Tableau are not included as they were too large, therefore to utilize the Tableau material, one must process the files themselves using the R material provided.
